# Flagle
A flag guessing game inspired by Wordle, [Fun with Flags](https://github.com/eddmann/fun-with-flags/) and [Worldle](https://github.com/teuteuf/worldle)!

Feel free to give me feature suggestions!

Play it here: www.flagle.io

# Building locally
Just clone/fork the repo and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

`npm start` will start a development server to test things out.

I used React for this project.
